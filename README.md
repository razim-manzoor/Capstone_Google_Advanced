# Customer Churn Prediction

## About This Project

This is a machine learning project where I developed a model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The goal was to demonstrate my ability to clean and preprocess data, build predictive models, and evaluate model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas, Numpy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**

## How I Built It

1. **Data Collection**: Collected customer data and preprocessed it to handle missing values.
2. **Modeling**: Trained and evaluated multiple models like decision trees and logistic regression.
3. **Evaluation**: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall for model performance.
4. **Visualization**: Visualized key metrics to explain model predictions.

## Features and Key Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- **Custom Algorithm**: Developed a custom feature engineering pipeline.
- **Model Evaluation**: Included cross-validation and ROC curve analysis.

## Project Goals and Outcome

The goal was to create a model to predict customer churn with high accuracy. The outcome was a model with 85% accuracy, demonstrating my ability to solve business problems using data science.
